Research
======
**Family Time-Income Allocation** (with José A. Rodrigues-Neto), *Working paper*
  - *Abstract*: This paper models the time and income allocation of a two-agent family. Each agent chooses the time they spend producing a household public good and the time working to earn income. Agents have interdependent (altruistic) preferences and can make a voluntary financial transfer to the other agent. We find the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the non-cooperative game, and the corresponding allocation and utilities. We compare the non-cooperative NE to Pareto efficient allocations. In a cooperative family, agents allocate their time and income by symmetric Nash bargaining, using the non-cooperative NE as the disagreement point. Finally, this paper calculates the marginal effects in each agent's ability to earn income on the cooperative income allocation and the indirect utility.

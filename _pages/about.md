I am a fourth-year PhD candidate from the Research School of Economics, Australian National University. My research interests include applied game theory, decision theory and structural estimation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Jose Rodrigues-Neto, Idione Meneghel and Ruitian Lang from the Research School of Economics, Australian National University.
